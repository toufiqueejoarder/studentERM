# The main features of this program are:

## Security:
This program has a login system which asks the user to enter Username and Password.If the login credentials entered by user are incorrect the he will not be able to access the program. The default values required to login are:
Usernme = ammar
Password = 12345

## Time & Date Function:
A time calculating function is included in this program. This function calculates the current time and date and prints it on the screen.

## Data Sorting:
Program can show data in both ascending and descending order for the ease of access. Now it takes the roll number as a key and sorts data around it. You can also change it to CGPA.

## BST Data Structure:
BST stands for Binary Search Tree. The main reason behind using this data structure is fast access. When data is being organized, a programmerâ€™s highest priority is to organize it in such a way that item insertion, deletion, and lookups (searches) are fast. For example, If we want to find a specific student in an unsorted array then we have to traverse the whole array which is very time consuming. We can use BST which reduces the access time for a specific record. The time complexity of BST is O(log2n).

## Total no. of records:
This program also tells the total number of students present in the list. Basically one node of BST contains the record of one student. So, this program counts the total no. of nodes which is also the total no. of students. Program also tells the depth of a specific node.

## Graphics:
The interface of this student management system program is designed using good sense of background and foreground color.
